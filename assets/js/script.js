var poemStorm = `
I sense a storm brewing.
Atop the bank looking down,
Into the quarry
a dirty scar.

The acrid wall of cloud closes in,
Stealing my shadow away.
It matches my mood.

My cigarette is good for one last drag,
The ember spits back as it hits the floor,
I quit. But my nerves didn’t.

I need the cleanse,
My tie whips out behind me,
It is nearly here.

A distant rumble fills the stone cemetery,
Then a crack lights up. Everything.
One drop of rain stains my shirt.

The downpour will start soon.
Past mistakes seem irrelevant now,
Mother Nature, I feel your wrath.

I am drenched, but feel nothing.
The elements shroud me,
A baptism from a higher power.

Thunder rumbles in. louder louder
Is this the eye?
I think so. Yes.

My time has come,
It all lead up to this.
I sensed a storm brewing.`
var poemMyFriend = `
Are you fulfilled, my friend?
With how your life is going.

Does the sun burn blue?
 Or the moon shine green?

Are you happy, my friend?
With the relationships you have.

Do birds fly rockets?
 Or toads drive cars?

Are you content, my friend?
With your job you work so hard at.

Are the mountains hollow?
Or the volcanoes imagination?
 
Are you satisfied, my friend?
With how you are, inside and out.

Do tides control themselves?
Or salt water taste sweet?

Are you proud, my friend?
With all your achievements in life.

Do clouds have dreams?
Or the skies feel emotion?

My friend,
Are you sad?

Tell me truly,
Is the world evil?
`
var poemRoadTripOfLife = `
Imagine life being a road.
Each life has its own road,
All different lengths,
All with different views.

What type of road is yours?
A quaint country lane,
Or a sprawling city motorway.
A quiet suburban avenue,
Or a secluded cobbled street.
All has its own unique beauty.

But really is it about the road?
Or how we enjoy the drive,
The pot holes and speed bumps,
We have them all.

My road goes over a bridge,
Yours can too.
Mine ends at the river,
For a new journey upon its currents.
`
var poemHangoverHotel = `
We arrive,
In the early morning, stumble in, drop your change.
Then. Crash.

That’s the easy part.
Here comes the hangover,
Head in hands on the toilet.
Piecing together last night,
Throb, Throb, Throb.

No water will help,
This is a bad one,
And here to stay.
Your coffees gone cold,
You shiver, you sip.
It’s still a no go.

Don’t stand up,
You’ll just feel worse.
Don’t think about what you drank,
That’ll just make you sick.
Oh wait. Too late.

That bottle of wine,
Two beers,
Seven shots,
And the doner kebab.
All comes up.
And up and up.

Your five minute revive,
Feels so good,
But you’ll be back in Hangover City soon.
Feeling worse,
All groggy and sore.

Why do you drink?
The question rattling around your mind,
Every time you visit,
You know how bad it feels.
Yet forget the ache,
The hollowness in your head,
Your body made of lead.

No worries, 
Next week, you’ll forget,
Because we all have a room reserved,
In the Hangover Hotel.
`
var poemBurningUnkown = `
It’s burning,
Over the roofs,
Over their skies.
An intense fire,
And you’re the only one who sees.

Down it drops,
Plummeting to the empty ground.
It’s been hot,
The fields will catch.

But is it just fire,
Or something more, Maybe?
Is it extra-terrestrial,
Or my drunken imagination.
I cannot tell,
Should it be clearer by morning.

I go to the site,
And find scorched burns,
But no remains.
Just a charred track,
To another unconfirmed path.

It leads far and across,
To lands not quite our own.
But then again, how can they be ours,
If no one cherishes them.
There is no sign,
Of the burning phenomenon.

And I am left,
Chasing the unknown.  
`
var poemNeedOrWant = `
Do you need it, or want it?
How hard it is to define,
You say you need what you want,
But never want what you need. 

You build yourself up with a confused rage,
Lost in memories.
There sweet and safe.
You need their comfort?

I want you to listen,
To the cliché.
There is light at the end of the tunnel,
But it is long,
Why do you think you’re going down alone,
Hold out your hand.
We’re here too.

You need the closure of knowing.
You need it to help.
But does the knowledge change facts,
Or what’s happened.
Does it build new defences?
Against the torrent of what’s gone before.
Exactly.

Replace your wants with needs.
There the true answer lies.
`
var poemDoctorGoodlove = `
Doc, listen. But don’t help.
The line between need and want is all blurry, 
I crave the silence of solitude,
Gone are the days of idle chelp.

A new sense of blandness, has come into life,
The taste is meaningless,
Eating has become another gruelling chore,
My emotions stuck in a constant state of strife.

Doc. You still there. Good.
I don’t know why I’m telling you this,
You’re getting paid, nodding away the hours.
Still, I’m told conversations are better than blood.

Hmm? The girl I miss you ask?
Gone. On with a new life, leaving
Me here, with nothing.
But I’ll only ever show the filthy mask.

What about work?
Ha! Full of joy that one.
Just count the hours till home, like you.
But I am just a common clerk.

I feel so ugly, Doc.
I have no mirrors because I cannot stand to see myself,
It’s sad but true,
Can’t you just put me in a room and leave on the lock.

Another hour been and gone,
Yes I agree Doc,

Just another bad day.
`
var poemDejaVu = `
Day in, work.
Day out, work.
Repeat. Over and over and over.

The same days, turn 
Into the same weeks,
Turn into the same,
Months turn years.
Then before you know it,
The same life.

Try spice it up by,
Going to a pub, you always do,
Having the same pint at the usual table,
Before you know it. Habit and routine.

How to change.
Because when you try,
The past hides in the future,
Only wearing a new face.

Repetition becomes boring,
Boring leads to content.
So I suppose that’s, that.

Would you look at the time,
6:30 again.
Time for another day.
The same day as yesterday.
`
var poemWhatIf = `

Tale as old as time,
Beauty and the beast, 
How sweet?
But beauty needs beauty
And beast is left with beast
How true.

What do we have left,
Insecurities and scars,
It’s redundant now.
I know I wasn’t perfect
But, hell. I tried,
So hard I cried. 

We both have new lives,
Yours, happiness and joy,
Mine, sadness and sleepless nights.
I’m fine honestly,
I’ve stopped caring. 
About most things.

Life goes on,
And us with it,
We were lovers in our prime,
Oblivious to the growing cleft,
Take the memories to the archives,
To bring out in solitude,
And wonder the age old question.
What if?
`
var poemJoinMe = `
Come on in, the water’s fine.
Have a swim, or just float for a while,
You can watch for a little if you want.
It’s okay.
I’m not leaving.

She’ll be here,
You’ll want to be in before she gets here,
So she can join you.
Join us. Join me.
It’s getting lonely in here.

Take your time,
It’s cold at first, but you’ll get used to it,
We all do.
So if we all get used to it,
Why not join me already.

You know you want to,
I can tell by your eyes.
How you chew your bottom lip.
Can you feel the water yet?

Live the fantasy,
She will come in due time,
Don’t worry. And don’t be scared.
It’s really quite pleasant once you’re in.
Take the plunge,
One quick dive.
That’s it!
Have a running jump.

Join me, boy. 
`
var poemSymbols = `
How quickly a world can change,
From the ashes and brimstone,
To clean offices and fresh forests.
It came with a symbol.
That I wear secret. Safe. 

The symbol is frail. Growth.
Shrouded in mystery, why did I choose this?
You wouldn’t understand.
To me it’s everything, 
The will in despair. 

Eagles. Symbol of freedom.
But you are not free,
Me?
Neither free nor liberated,
But my symbol does not lie.

They are similar though.
Comfort is brought by them, 
Pledges are made by them.
Pacts in blood. Secrets.
My sweet symbol, save the martyr.
`
var poemFoolsTheLotOfYou = `
The colour is magenta,
Of what?
Wait, it’s more violet now,
Of. What?
You tell me, colour by association,
It doesn’t really matter.

Try imagining a new colour,
Already have, haven’t we all.
What’s it most like?
What is it associated with,
Go from there,
The background can matter.

Black.
Colour or shade,
It absorbs all anyway,
Just don’t get lost in technicalities,
It makes no sense to.
Smoking gun.
That’s more of a grey,
Isn’t it?

Your colour,
Bright or dark,
Your choice. It’s ‘original’
Remember.
Your personality is reflected,
Does it make sense now,
Your colour is you,
Can be dropped into sub-categories.

What does your colour say about you,
No. don’t tell me,
Just fill out the form,
Tick the box. Initial.
Tell the therapist, room 14.

Next.

The colour is cyan,
Of what?
Wait, it’s more aqua now. 
Of. What?
Exactly.
What is the point.
`
var poemMyMessage = `
Will you meet me?
At a predetermined place,
At a predetermined time?
In the early morning,
When the view is hidden by grey,
It will be raining,
But that’s okay. 
You don’t have to talk,
Your presence is enough.

If I leave,
Will you come with me,
But don’t follow,
I don’t wish to lead.
We are alone here,
Our sanctuary for a few hours,
Until morning melts into day.
The rain stops,
Grey fades to the light,
I will be gone long before then,
And you?

For now we are alone,
I am contempt with silence and glances,
Your presence is enough,
I will be here again,
Will you meet me then?
That is your decision,
Mine already made.

We find the details we do not like,
Then focus on them,
Don’t let them blind you,
Let them scare you to excitement.
Amaze me.
`
var poemRipple = `
A rock drops,
Into a lake,
Sending ripples out,
Towards the shore.
The birds call,
Another stone,
We walk hand in hand,
Around and around.

The ripples come back,
Lazily lapping up the sand,
We sit down,
And throw a few more.
We don’t look at each other,
Don’t speak,
Just holding,
That’s all that’s important.

We sit for the day,
Frozen by the sun,
The lake doesn’t change,
It’s been a still day.
We dust ourselves off,
Throw a few more rocks,
Watch the ripples,
Then adventure home.

It’s late now,
And dark,
There is still no talk,
Still no looks.
I drop you at your house,
And return back to mine,
The silence has engulfed,
Ripples passing through.

You’re gone now,
Far, far away,
Will you throw a rock,
And make a ripple. Again.
Are you thinking of me,
When the water laps back,
Because I am of you,
The ripple in my life.
`
var poemANewChapter = `
So it begins.
From the toppled empire,
Grows a bud.
Between the cracked stone,
The green emerges,
Curling up into the sunlight,
A slow blossom unfolds.

So it continues.
More grow, taking over,
What was once.
Colour and birdcall engulfs all,
Eroding down the old,
Turing civilisation back to nature,
Vines hike the tallest monument.

So it thrives.
There is no trace,
Of the wonders that man made,
Only nature,
Only peace,
The trees of colossal size,
Will not be felled,
For tarmac kingdoms.
The baboons live in harmony,
Eating only there share,
Enjoying each passing season,
How they were intended to be enjoyed.

So it eventually ends.
The baboons evolve,
To creatures of greed.
Skirmishes for territory begins,
The rape of the land,
For raw resources.
The birdsong is heard no more,
The colour drains out,
Content for life how it was.
A legend.

So it concludes.
